                <p>
                    People and organization efforts have become central to every company’s success. As a result, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated that @Model.CompanyName report your “Human Capital” in 2021 and subsequent filings. To date, most Human Capital disclosures report isolated initiatives (e.g., number of days of training, diversity of workforce, pay ratio of CEO to average employee, employee retention, and so forth) that are not integrated or linked to financial, employee, or social citizenship results. The SEC mandated disclosure gives @Model.CompanyName the opportunity to better report and deliver on your Human Capital initiatives so that they will improve employee productivity, profitability, intangible value, and social citizenship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This report analyzes your SEC Human Capital disclosure that you filed with the SEC in 2021. In this report, we show the link between Human Capability investments and financial and other business outcomes. We benchmarked @Model.CompanyName to the 7000 companies that filed with the SEC and propose specific actions you can take to improve what you report and help prioritize your investments. We provide a standard format for you to measure, monitor, improve and leverage your Human Capital investments over time.

                    G3HC (G3 Human Capability) cofounders, Dave Ulrich and Norm Smallwood, collaborated with Amazon AWS to create this service by combining expertise in technology with our thirty years of research and applied experience in Human Capability. Using cutting-edge machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) we analyze and compare SEC Human Capital reports to provide specific advice on where to prioritize efforts and what you can do to improve what you report.

                    This report provides the rationale for why Human Capability is important as well as information about how @Model.CompanyName scores and how that
score compares to others in your industry, all other companies in the SEC and to the top 10%. In addition, based on your scores, we direct you to our G3HC Actionable Insights which provide specific ideas for what to invest in and what to report for your next filing. This service provides a standard framework for Human Capital reporting so that companies can measure and compare.

            <p><strong>1.1 Why Human Capability</strong></p>
            <p>Simply stated, improvement in Human Capability (talent + leadership + organization + HR) will increase @Model.CompanyName’s results on a number of dimensions (see G3HC Actionable Insights for list of studies to confirm these findings).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market value is increasingly tied to intangible assets (across industries intangibles as a part of market value have increased from 17% in 1975 to over 80% in 2022) and correlated with Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li>Financial (cash flow, EBITDA, Tobin’s Q) value comes from high performing work systems, or the integration of Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li>Customer value as measured by net promoter score, customer share, or customer retention comes from employee experience and organization culture.</li>
                <li>Strategic realization is the ability to reinvent and deliver on strategic goals tied to Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li>Employee productivity and experience is derived from Human Capability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">The results that derive from Human Capability investments help @Model.CompanyName’s external and internal stakeholders reach their goals.</p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">External stakeholders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investors</strong> want more information on Human Capability to predict the likelihood of business strategies being realized and to track intangible value which is an increasing component of overall market value. Compare your firm’s price/earnings ratio over the last 5 years with your four largest competitors to determine a high-level indicator of investor confidence in @Model.CompanyName’s Human Capability.</li>
                <li><strong>The SEC</strong> (in U.S.) wants consistent, reliable, and transparent information on Human Capital so that investors and others can access and compare information.</li>
                <li><strong>Social media</strong> and communities want to share insights on how organizations manage their reputation and social citizenship (e.g., ESG).</li>
                <li><strong>Customers</strong> want to experience increasingly superior products and services because of more stable Human Capability (customer attitude is highly correlated to employee attitude). </li>
                <li><strong>Future employees</strong> want to work in organizations where they can learn new skills, are more engaged and find meaning in their work.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boards of directors</strong> want to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility by ensuring Human Capability that enables their company to respond to future opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Business leaders</strong> at all levels want to ensure that their missions, strategies, and goals are likely to be realized through the Human Capability they create.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor relations</strong> wants to share intangible value of Human Capability in investor communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Human resource professionals</strong> want to prioritize Human Capability investments that will have the most impact on results that matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Current employees</strong> want to work for a company that treats them with respect, rewards their contributions and creates an overall sense of fulfillment.</li>

            <p><strong>1.2 What the government (SEC) requests.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Because Human Capability is increasingly material to all stakeholders, the SEC mandated Human Capital reporting (see G3HC Actionable Insights section 1 for legal requirement). The response to the SEC Human Capital requirement in 2021 varies dramatically in length (ranging from under 200 words to over 2,000); in content covered (from safety to unions to broad axioms to specific quantitative data); and in location in the report (a separate section, risk, or management and discussion
                analysis). There is currently a lack of agreement for standard logic for the report. Today’s Human Capital reporting is analogous to a single financial measure (e.g., inventory turnover or free cash flow) as a complete indicator
                of financial performance. Clearly, this doesn’t make sense. The acceptance of standardized and accepted people and organization frameworks and metrics allows integration of Human Capability initiatives and comparison across
                companies.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1.3 Human Capability evolution and definition</strong></p>
            <p>
                To overcome this unstructured reporting of Human Capital, we propose an evolution and building blocks of Human Capability in Figure 1. This figure gives @Model.CompanyName executives a shared language to talk about the evolution of the
                myriad of concepts related to Human Capability.

            The Human Capability column in Figure 1 can be further defined with a comprehensive and standardized framework that offers a compelling way to organize and discuss @Model.CompanyName’s numerous initiatives in talent, organization, leadership,
            and HR. The Human Capability framework in Figure 2 offers a simple and robust way to organize the array of people and organization activities into four pathways that can be discussed both inside @Model.CompanyName as well as shared and
            compared with those outside @Model.CompanyName. G3HC Actionable Insights sections 5 through 8 show items that can be included in each of the four pathways of Figure 2. In G3HC Actionable Insights there are 37 initiatives and over 100 playbooks, articles and videos in each of the four domains identified.

        <p><strong>2.1 Overall findings</strong> <br />Your company report is based on innovative machine learning that delivers far stronger predictions of business results than previous studies using surveys. Of the 7,000 organizations who filed 10-K SEC reports in 2021, 5,760 had sufficient data to include in this study. </p>
        <p>
            The Human Capability framework we tested had an accuracy at 89% with which the machine learning model is able to distinguish Human Capital text from non-Human Capital text. This means that the Human Capability framework in Figure 2 can be applied to create
            a Human Capability score for each of the 5,760 organizations. This finding gives confidence in the reliability (consistency) and validity (accuracy) for your company's Human Capability scores. Instead of fragmented and isolated people and organization measures, this study confirms that this Human Capability framework is a way to organize and prioritize your company’s investments.
        </p>
        <p>Across the 5,760 organizations, our machine learning application showed the impact of Human Capability investments on five business outcomes. </p>

            It is important to note that these results are dramatically higher - twice as high - than previous Human Capital research using surveys on smaller organization samples as the data gathering method. Human Capability accounts for:
            </p>
            <ul id="2-1-postlist-list">
                <li>Employee outcomes: 44.5% of revenue per employee</li>
                <li>Financial outcomes: 26% of earnings (EBITDA) and 25% of investor confidence in future (Tobin’s Q)</li>
                <li>Corporate Social Responsibility outcomes: 36% of fraud and 48% of litigiousness (legal cases)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="footnote-block">Our research validates the accuracy of the Human Capability framework and the impact of this framework on key business outcomes that matter to you. It also suggests that use of SEC filings is a valuable source of information for Human Capability assessment. Further, as companies improve and standardize their reporting around Human Capital, our machine learning model improves how to define, track, improve, and compare Human Capability initiatives.

                <p>
                    Based on what you reported, you received an overall score (1 to 10) in each pathway. Using proprietary machine learning technology, we analyzed the report for evidence of these concepts in each pathway.

                <p>
                    This analysis of Human Capability reporting was used to create @(Model.CompanyName)'s score on each of the four pathways with a normalized range from 1 to 10. This scoring enables an analysis of where @Model.CompanyName stands in relation to others based on their Human Capability reporting.

                <b>Low Hanging Fruit:</b> Human Capability initiatives that you are pursuing but have not reported for one of two reasons. First, if you believe that these initiatives are proprietary and you do not want to share them
                under today’s regulations, you do not need to report them. Second, if they are not proprietary and you believe that reporting these initiatives would better signal your Human Capability, you can
                start to report them and these initiatives will positively impact your future scores.

            <p>
                As @Model.CompanyName updates its annual Human Capital report to the SEC, you can include discussion of talent, organization, leadership, and HR initiatives from the information in the G3HC Actionable Insights that @Model.CompanyName has invested in. This updated
                annual SEC report will demonstrate progress in @Model.CompanyName’s commitment to building Human Capability. Just as financial metrics offer a number of insights about financial performance that are tailored to a company’s business,
                @Model.CompanyName’s Human Capability reporting should focus on those initiatives that give others greater confidence in your Human Capability agenda, i.e., that your Human Capability agenda is targeted to increasing business outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>Each year, the quality of Human Capability reporting to the SEC will increase, so @Model.CompanyName should have an annual Human Capability reporting process to track your performance.</p>

            G3HC Actionable Insights 1: SEC Human Capital Requirement
        </h2>
        <p>
            The SEC report on Human Capital comes via the Federal Register - Final Rule: Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105; Release Nos. 33-10825; 34-89670; File No. S7-11-19 on November 9, 2020. These rules modernize the requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to disclosure of the description of the business (Item 101), legal proceedings (Item 103) and risk factors (Item 105). This greatly expands Human Capability management disclosures. Today, reporting structure is not detailed, so companies are free to report Human Capital items in any way they choose. The wording of the rule is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            Item 101(c)(2)(ii): Provide “A description of the registrant’s Human Capital resources, including the number of persons employed by the registrant, and any Human Capital measures or objectives that the registrant focuses on in managing
            the business (such as, depending on the nature of the registrant’s business and workforce, measures or objectives that address the development, attraction and retention of personnel).”

            <li>
                Talent (also called Human Capital) deals with initiatives to ensure the right individual competence, workforce, or people: Improving how employees work through hiring based on cultural fit, orienting new employees to their job, hybrid work that determines where and how employees work, focusing on worktasks and skills more than roles, creating total reward systems to motivate employees, attending to employee physical health and psychological well-being, reskilling the workforce, managing employee careers, using digital communications, creating a DEI agenda, managing employee mobility through retention and removal efforts, building a better employee experience, and so forth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leadership emphasizes initiatives improving the quality of both individual leaders and collective leadership by: Building a business case for leadership, defining what makes an effective leader, assessing quality of leaders and
                leadership, investing in leadership development training and coaching, measuring leadership results, and ensuring leadership reputation.

            <li>
                Organization (structure, governance, or culture) focuses on initiatives that define and ensure the right organization capabilities such as: Agility (moving quickly to adapt to change), strategic clarity (having a compelling purpose or mission), technology adoption (accessing digital information to reinvent work), culture (having the right values that create value for stakeholders), social responsibility (being a good social citizen), customer focus (increasing customer intimacy), innovation (discovering and delivering new ways to work), collaboration (working in networks or ecosystems), and so forth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Human Resources refers to the HR function or department and how to accomplish HR work by: Upgrading the HR department by ensuring the right reputation, serving customers, having a clear purpose, governing and organizing to deliver HR work, doing HR analytics, improving HR professionals, building positive work relationships, and so forth.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This Human Capability framework in Figure 2 and 37 initiatives in Figure 5 helps @Model.CompanyName business and HR leaders define, invest in, prioritize, measure, and improve Human Capability much like the SEC required financial disclosures (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) to guide financial decisions.

            These research studies help identify the extent to which specific initiatives in each pathway are deployed. Further, this research links the Human Capability initiatives in each pathway to stakeholder outcomes by asking “so that” or
            “because of” to ensure the linkages. Figure 6 shows the logic of creating value through Human Capability investments. This research confirms that Human Capability initiatives impact firm performance across industries and geographies.
        </p>
        <p>All of these studies are based on surveys from key informants which give insight into how an organization operates, but often focus on single initiatives, have response biases, and are difficult to scale.</p>

            G3HC Actionable Insights 4: Innovative Human Capability research using machine learning
        </h2>
        <p>
            To overcome survey limitations, this report uses information reported in the mandated 10-K SEC disclosures. Results in this report come from extracting all sentences related to Human Capability for each of the SEC filing companies who reported to the SEC in 2021 by using the Human Capability definitions for the four pathways in Figure 2.
        </p>
        <p>Then, using proprietary machine learning technology, seed words for each of the four pathways were identified and word lists for each of the four pathways were created. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Talent = talent + employee + competence</li>
            <li>Leadership = leadership + management + develop</li>
            <li>Organization = organization + culture + agility + mission + vision + capability</li>
            <li>HR = Human Capital + human resources</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Using these word lists, the fraction of the Human Capability text that contains the words in a given list were used to create @Model.CompanyName’s score on each of the four pathways with a normalized range from 1 to 10. This scoring enables
            an analysis of how @Model.CompanyName stands in relation to others based on their Human Capability reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefit of applying this Human Capability framework to SEC reports is that these reports are for regulatory compliance where firms are accountable for integrity. This is not the case for media reports, ratings, or earnings calls,
            which may be more promotional. Further, manual processing and interpretation of surveys does not scale, whereas machine learning processing of SEC filings enables scaling to all companies disclosing public data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Human Capability framework and machine learning analytics has limitations. The Human Capability framework is based on extensive research but could miss some elements of how your organization attends to talent, leadership, organization,
            and HR. The information analyzed came from company reports to the SEC and companies had few requirements on what to report. The data are a single point in time since 2021 was the first year of required Human Capital disclosures.
            Over time, this baseline framework and assessment will evolve to offer an increasingly accurate portrayal of @Model.CompanyName’s Human Capability.

            G3HC Actionable Insights 9: Sharing Human Capability with other stakeholders
        </h2>
        <p>The Human Capability report you share with the SEC can also be shared with other key groups to increase confidence that business results will occur.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">
            External Stakeholders
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Investors. Include Human Capability report as part of investor relations communications, including monthly or quarter investor calls, debt discussions, and shareholder meetings. Include investors or analyst who follow @Model.CompanyName to participate in human resource activities (staffing, training, performance reviews).
            </li>
            <li>SEC (in U.S.). Upgrade your annual disclosure to the SEC with more integrated, thorough, and tailored reports about specific Human Capability investments @Model.CompanyName makes. </li>
            <li>
                Social media. By sharing Human Capability information through social media, @Model.CompanyName can create a positive reputation in the community. This will affect the ability to attract future employees and build customer confidence.
                Be willing to share Human Capability information in this report and specific stories of success.
            </li>
            <li>
                Customers. Since employee engagement and the right culture are lead indicators of customer engagement and customer share, make sure that customers participate in defining and delivering Human Capability. Involve them in human resource
                activities and make sure that the HR activities deliver on customer promises (e.g., hire people who are the customer’s most important asset).
            </li>
            <li>Future employees. By building a positive Human Capability reputation, the number of qualified applicants who want to work at @Model.CompanyName will increase. Your people are your gateway for your future. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="mb-4">
            Internal Stakeholders
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Boards of Directors. Boards have a fiduciary responsibility for strategic, financial, and CEO performance. Add Human Capability to this charter by doing regular updates on Human Capability investments and outcomes in addition to
                the annual deep dives into executive compensation and succession.
            </li>
            <li>
                Business leaders. In framing business strategies, make sure that there is a disciplined assessment of Human Capability. For example, a merger or acquisition should do a thorough Human Capability assessment to determine risk and
                price. Similar growth strategies for product or service innovation, customer share, or geographic expansion should carefully consider Human Capability as a key element of strategic success.
            </li>
            <li>
                Human resource professionals. While line managers are the “owners” of Human Capability initiatives, HR professionals should become architects, designers, coaches, and facilitators of Human Capability investments. Invest in upgrading
                the quality of HR professionals to make sure they are valued contributors.
            </li>
            <li>Current employees. Through sharing @Model.CompanyName’s Human Capability agenda, your current employees should be able to feel a personal connection to @Model.CompanyName that will help them give their best efforts. </li>
        </ul>
