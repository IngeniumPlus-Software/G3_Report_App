                <p>
                    People and organization efforts have become central to every company’s success. As a result, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated that @Model.CompanyName report your “Human Capital” in 2021 and subsequent filings. To date, most Human Capital disclosures report isolated initiatives (e.g., number of days of training, diversity of workforce, pay ratio of CEO to average employee, employee retention, and so forth) that are not integrated or linked to financial, employee, or social citizenship results. The SEC mandated disclosure gives @Model.CompanyName the opportunity to better report and deliver on your Human Capital initiatives so that they will improve employee productivity, profitability, intangible value, and social citizenship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This report analyzes your SEC Human Capital disclosure that you filed with the SEC in @Model.YearString. In this report, we show the link between Human Capability investments and financial and other business outcomes. We benchmarked @Model.CompanyName to the 7000 companies that filed with the SEC and propose specific actions you can take to improve what you report and help prioritize your investments. We provide a standard format for you to measure, monitor, improve and leverage your Human Capital investments over time.

                    G3HC (G3 Human Capability) cofounders, Dave Ulrich and Norm Smallwood, collaborated with Amazon AWS to create this service by combining expertise in technology with our thirty years of research and applied experience in Human Capability. Using cutting-edge machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) we analyze and compare SEC Human Capital reports to provide specific advice on where to prioritize efforts and what you can do to improve what you report.

In addition, based on your scores, we direct you to our G3HC Actionable Insights which provide specific ideas for what to invest in and what to report for your next filing. This service provides a standard framework for Human Capital reporting so that companies can measure and compare.

            Executive Summary
        </h2>
        <p class="es-top-text">
            In @Model.YearString, @Model.CompanyName reported your Human Capital as part of your SEC ﬁlings. We created a standard framework of four pathways (talent + leadership + organization + human resources) to look beyond Human Capital for all references to <b>Human Capability</b> anywhere in your 10k. Using proprietary machine learning technology that delivers far stronger predictions of business results than previous studies using surveys, we analyzed your 10K for evidence of these concepts in each pathway. Our approach allowed for measurement and comparison across companies in same way that is done for ﬁnancial reporting.
        </p>
        <p class="es-top-text">
            Based on what you reported, @Model.CompanyName received an overall score (1 to 10) in each pathway and compared with your industry, all companies filing with the SEC and the top 10% as shown in the bar chart and table below.  This scoring enables an analysis of where @Model.CompanyName stands in relation to others based on their Human Capability reporting.

            <p><strong>1.1 Why Human Capability</strong></p>
            <p>Simply stated, improvement in Human Capability (talent + leadership + organization + HR) will increase @Model.CompanyName’s results on a number of dimensions (see the G3HC website members' portal for actionable insights to confirm these findings).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market</strong> value is increasingly tied to intangible assets (across industries intangibles as a part of market value have increased from 17% in 1975 to over 80% in 2022) and correlated with Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Financial</strong> (cash flow, EBITDA, Tobin’s Q) value comes from high performing work systems, or the integration of Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer</strong> value as measured by net promoter score, customer share, or customer retention comes from employee experience and organization culture.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic</strong> realization is the ability to reinvent and deliver on strategic goals tied to Human Capability initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee</strong> productivity and experience is derived from Human Capability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">The results that derive from Human Capability investments help @Model.CompanyName’s external and internal stakeholders reach their goals.</p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">External stakeholders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investors</strong> want more information on Human Capability to predict the likelihood of business strategies being realized and to track intangible value which is an increasing component of overall market value. Compare your firm’s price/earnings ratio over the last 5 years with your four largest competitors to determine a high-level indicator of investor confidence in @Model.CompanyName’s Human Capability.</li>
                <li><strong>The SEC</strong> (in U.S.) wants consistent, reliable, and transparent information on Human Capital so that investors and others can access and compare information.</li>
                <li><strong>Social</strong> media and communities want to share insights on how organizations manage their reputation and social citizenship (e.g., ESG).</li>
                <li><strong>Customers</strong> want to experience increasingly superior products and services because of more stable Human Capability (customer attitude is highly correlated to employee attitude). </li>
                <li><strong>Future employees</strong> want to work in organizations where they can learn new skills, are more engaged and find meaning in their work.</li>

            <li><strong>Business leaders</strong> at all levels want to ensure that their missions, strategies, and goals are likely to be realized through the Human Capability they create.</li>
            <li><strong>Investor relations</strong> wants to share intangible value of Human Capability in investor communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Human resource professionals</strong> want to prioritize Human Capability investments that will have the most impact on results that matter.</li>

            <p><strong>1.2 What the government (SEC) requests.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Because Human Capability is increasingly material to all stakeholders, the SEC mandated Human Capital reporting (see Appendix 1 for legal requirement). The response to the SEC Human Capital requirement has varied dramatically in length (ranging from under 200 words to over 2,000); in content covered (from safety to unions to broad axioms to specific quantitative data); and in location in the report (a separate section, risk, or management and discussion
                analysis). There is currently a lack of agreement for standard logic for the report. Today’s Human Capital reporting is analogous to a single financial measure (e.g., inventory turnover or free cash flow) as a complete indicator
                of financial performance. Clearly, this doesn’t make sense. The acceptance of standardized and accepted people and organization frameworks and metrics allows integration of Human Capability initiatives and comparison across
                companies.
            </p>
            <p><strong>1.3 Human Capability evolution and definition</strong></p>
            <p>
                To overcome this unstructured reporting of Human Capital, we propose an evolution and building blocks of Human Capability in Figure 1. This figure gives @Model.CompanyName executives a shared language to talk about the evolution of the
                myriad of concepts related to Human Capability.

            The Human Capability column in Figure 1 can be further defined with a comprehensive and standardized framework that offers a compelling way to organize and discuss @Model.CompanyName’s numerous initiatives in talent, organization, leadership, and HR. The Human Capability framework in Figure 2 offers a simple and robust way to organize the array of people and organization activities into four pathways that can be discussed both inside @Model.CompanyName as well as shared and compared with those outside @Model.CompanyName. In G3HC members' portal for actionable insights, there are 38 initiatives and over 100 playbooks, articles and videos in each of the four domains identified.

        </h2>
        <p><strong>2.1 Overall findings</strong> <br />Your company report is based on innovative machine learning that delivers far stronger predictions of business results than previous studies using surveys. Of the 7,000 organizations who filed 10-K SEC reports in 2021, 5,760 had sufficient data to include in our initial study. </p>
        <p>
            The Human Capability framework we tested had an accuracy at 89% with which the machine learning model is able to distinguish Human Capital text from non-Human Capital text. This means that the Human Capability framework in Figure 2 can be applied to create
            a Human Capability score for each of the 5,760 organizations. This finding gives confidence in the reliability (consistency) and validity (accuracy) for your company's Human Capability scores. Instead of fragmented and isolated people and organization measures, this study confirms that this Human Capability framework is a way to organize and prioritize your company’s investments.
        </p>
        <p>Across the 5,760 organizations, our machine learning application showed the impact of Human Capability investments on five business outcomes. </p>

        <p class="table-note">Note: R2 is a statistic that explains the dependent variable (employee, financial, and social citizenship) by the score on the independent variable (Human Capability score).</p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that these results are dramatically higher - twice as high - than previous Human Capital research using surveys on smaller organization samples as the data gathering method. Human Capability accounts for:
        </p>
        <ul id="2-1-postlist-list">
            <li>Employee outcomes: 44.5% of revenue per employee</li>
            <li>Financial outcomes: 26% of earnings (EBITDA) and 25% of investor confidence in future (Tobin’s Q)</li>
            <li>Corporate Social Responsibility outcomes: 36% of fraud and 48% of litigiousness (legal cases)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="footnote-block">
            Our research validates the accuracy of the Human Capability framework and the impact of this framework on key business outcomes that matter to you. It also suggests that use of SEC filings is a valuable source of information for Human Capability assessment. Further, as companies improve and standardize their reporting around Human Capital, our machine learning model improves how to define, track, improve, and compare Human Capability initiatives.

        <p>After interpreting your results in Section 3, you and your team should identify which pathways are the most critical priorities in the near term.  Strenthening your scores in these pathways will be derived from two choices.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Low hanging fruit:<br /> You have been rated as either low, medium or high in the pathway. Read through the list of Actionable Insights in the G3HC member's portal for the specific pathway. Ask yourself if any of these ideas are currently beign done in your organization but not reported. If yes, make some notes about what you “could have” reported but didn’t.
            </li>
            <li>
                Opportunities:<br />The Actionable Insights section for each pathway begins with an overview of what are the highest impact actions within the pathway that will improve your score.  You will also find hints on selecting your investment priorities depending on your score in the pathway.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Select your priority actions based on a balance of need and value.  Based on your Human Capability score in each pathway and after considering what you have done but did not report (low hanging fruit), rank order the priority of the four pathways in terms of improvement.   Improve upon weaknesses if pathways score below parity.   Build upon strengths in pathways where you strive to be, or maintain, a world class capability level.</p>

        <p><strong>4.1 Leveraging the Actionable Insights for each pathway</strong></p>
        <p>Our Human Capability Framework (see figure 5) will help @Model.CompanyName business and HR leaders define, invest in, prioritize, measure, and improve Human Capability much like the SEC required financial disclosures (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) to guide financial decisions. In the Actionable Insights you can find the 38 initiatives and over 100 playbooks, videos and articles that can comprise your plan to invest in and report in each of the four pathways.</p>

        <p>In reviewing the initiatives in each of the four Human Capability pathways, you can identify those that you believe enable @Model.CompanyName to deliver results. You can also disclose measures for each of those initiatives that will help others increase confidence in your Human Capability investments.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Validating your plan</strong></p>
        <p>As a final step in completing your plan, cross check that it is targeted at the stakeholder results (strategy, customer, employee, investor, community) that are most critical to your organization.  These result areas should be aligned with the metrics that you create to track plan progress and impact.  Where possible validate your plan with these key stakeholder groups.  This validation step may offer new insights about communicating your plan that will be covered in section 5 of this report.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Improve reporting to the SEC</strong></p>
        <p>As @Model.CompanyName updates its annual Human Capital report to the SEC, you can enhance the discussion of talent, leadership, organization and HR initiatives with the “low hanging fruit” and new “opportunities” that you are implementing. This updated annual SEC report will demonstrate progress in @(Model.CompanyName)’s commitment to building Human Capability. Just as financial metrics offer a number of insights about financial performance that are tailored to a company’s business, @(Model.CompanyName)’s Human Capability reporting should focus on those initiatives that give others greater confidence in your Human Capability agenda, i.e., that your Human Capability agenda is targeted to increasing business outcomes. Each year, the quality of Human Capability reporting to the SEC will increase, so @Model.CompanyName should have an annual Human Capability reporting process to track your performance.</p>

        <h3>1. Build the Case that Human Capability is a material issue</h3>
        <p>As outlined in Sections 1 and 2 of this report, research shows that people and organization deliver financial, customer, and community results.</p>
        <p>You can create a compelling case for Human Capability that is specific to your organization by collecting business measures and then interpreting the data in the context of your unique environment:</p>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Compare your P/E ratio vs. major competitors for the last 5 years</li>
            <li>Compare your Tobin’s Q vs. major competitors for the last 5 years</li>
            <li>Gather other metrics that are key indicators of performance in your industry (e.g., glassdoor.com, reputation indices)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="section-5-2" class="text-page section-5">
    <span class="counter"></span>
    <div>
        <p>Assess the trend line of your metrics to historical changes in your Human Capability policy, procedures, initiatives, and notable new events. Were there positive or negative perceptions regarding changes in your leadership, your current talent pipeline, ability to attract and retain critical talent, or changes in distinctive capabilities of your organization versus competitors?  Are there inflection points in your P/E or Tobin’s Q that can be tied to significant events that could be linked to Human Capability issues? Examples:  A key senior executive change? A merger or acquisition? The launch of a major product? A pandemic?</p>
        <p>Do you lead or lag competitors in key metrics?  Has your reputation within the industry’s top performers changed over time? </p>
        <p>As a final refinement, get the perspective of board members and executives regarding how much they think people and organization issues drive results as well as how your company compares to others they work with.  </p>
        <!--<div class="text-center">
            <span>
                (Follow this link (link and slides need to be created) to the G3 Human Capability website for helpful examples and slides that can be used as you Embed this Six Step process into your planning systems)
            </span>
        </div>-->
        <p>Before drafting your case for the materiality of Human Capability, take a moment to define your key stakeholders.  Consider the Board of Directors, Executive Team, organizational leadership, investor relations and investors, HR professionals, employees and any other relevant groups that are key to your organization’s competitive and financial success. Make an inventory of the common and different ways that Human Capability can impact these groups. </p>
        <p>Synthesize your quantitative data and understanding of stakeholder perspectives to create a compelling business case to communicate with each stakeholder group about how your organization is materially impacted by positive and negative changes in Human Capability or shifts in comparison to your industry peers. </p>
        <h3>Milestones of this step:</h3>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Compile key performance metrics of your business versus industry peers</li>
            <li>Segment stakeholder groups and how Human Capability impacts them </li>
            <li>Create a compelling message that Human Capability is a strategic issue</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Shift mindset from fragmented initiatives and activities to a systemic framework</h3>
        <p>Avoid the trap of thinking of single initiatives or programs as an overall Human Capability agenda. The Human Capability framework encompasses the majority of isolated people and organization initiatives and provides four complimentary pathways (Talent + Leadership + Organization + HR function) with 38 initiatives.  Like a menu at a restaurant, this framework is both simple (four categories) and comprehensive (38 initiatives).</p>
        <p>Map your current Human Capability investment “portfolio” onto the framework.  Are investments balanced across the Pathways?   Does the current state reveal any blind spots?  Does your current investment “portfolio” align with your conclusions and messaging regarding the case for material importance of Human Capability?</p>
        <p>Add the Human Capability Framework and any new insights to the messaging you are using with key stakeholders.  </p>
        <p>When engaging with stakeholders on people and organization issues, always refer to all four pathways, not just one or two initiatives or “silver bullets”. Improving Human Capability is NOT an “HR” agenda but a means to deliver value to stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Build out from the HR stakeholder group to create a team of champions that branches out to an enterprise-wide coalition that understands and adopts the framework and how it can impact Human Capability and results. </p>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="section-5-3" class="text-page section-5">
    <span class="counter"></span>
    <div>
        <p>Success for this step is represented by the formation of a cross functional team to manage the ongoing processes of Human Capability measurement, investment prioritization and communication.  This team is comprised of a subject matter expert for each HUMAN CAPABILITY pathway and senior representatives from investor relations, finance, legal and communications.  This team would be formally tasked to own the Human Capability building process and work throughout the year on steps 3 through 6 described below.  </p>
        <h3>Milestones of this step:</h3>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Add the G3HC Framework to your ongoing business strategy / resource allocation process</li>
            <li>Map your current state HUMAN CAPABILITY investment portfolio to the framework</li>
            <li>Socialize the model with key stakeholders to build understanding and alignment</li>
            <li>Create a cross functional team to champion the HUMAN CAPABILITY building process</li>
            <li>Embed the process into current strategic planning and business systems  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Measure, interpret and add new insights about your current G3HC scores in each Pathway</h3>
        <p>
            Investors and other stakeholders want to know how you are doing in the four pathways compared to all other firms,
            firms in your industry, and the top 10% of the SEC. Section 3 of this report provides scores for each of the four
            pathways versus these comparison groups. This information provides stakeholders with a visual dashboard of how you
            perform today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 4 describes the importance of interpreting your results through a lens of how comprehensively you report Human Capability for the year. Intentional or unintentional omissions in disclosing Human Capability investments will result in lower scores than they should be.
        </p>
        <h3>Milestones of this step include:</h3>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Understand your relative strengths and weaknesses across each Pathway</li>
            <li>Understand your comparisons to industry peers, the entire SEC and top 10%</li>
            <li>Critique the validity of your scores relative to what you actually disclosed</li>
            <li>Compare your portfolio of current investments to scores in each Pathway</li>
            <li>Assess the perceived ROI on investments made in each Pathway</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Set Human Capability goals and build a roadmap of future human capability investments to deliver outcomes that matter</h3>
        <p>Given your current human capability performance (step 3), stakeholders will want to know where and how you should prioritize future investments to build Human Capability and deliver value to them. </p>
        <p>First, link your Human Capability initiatives to results that matter. Look back at the performance indicators you used to build a case for Human Capability and select the result areas and specific improvements that are most important to this strategic planning cycle.  These targets define the value created for your Human Capability goals and priorities.</p>
        <p>Second, set goals for improving performance in each Pathway by linking the pathway to the business outcome.</p>
        <p>
            Third, review the G3HC actionable insights and supplement your current practices, programs and initiatives in each
            Pathway with new initiatives that will build greater capability. Rather than focus on a popular initiative because
            of
            personal interest, best practices, or those that are socially desirable, work though three questions to prioritize
            where
            to invest to deliver value:
        </p>

    <div>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>
                Weaknesses: How well do we do the initiative today? Focus on the pathways and initiatives where you are below
                parity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Impact: How much value does the initiative deliver to stakeholders? Focus on the pathways & initiatives that
                will most impact business results you care about.
            </li>
            <li>
                Differentiation: How strategic is the pathway to your strategy? Focus on the pathways and initiatives that most
                strategically differentiate you from others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Milestones of this step include:</h3>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Set business performance targets that are linked to the case for HUMAN CAPABILITY</li>
            <li>Set Pathway improvement goals that create stakeholder value </li>
            <li>Prioritize specific initiatives that improve or sustain stakeholder value. </li>
            <li>Combine improvement plans across Pathways to build a systemic HUMAN CAPABILITY Roadmap</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Track your performance over time to see improvements in both human capability initiatives and their impact on business results.</h3>
        <p>
            What gets measured gets done. The most important comparison is to track and communicate your company’s progress over
            time. As you prioritize and invest in Human Capability initiatives, you will be able to track improvements not only
            in how you score against others, but also how your Human Capability improvements deliver stakeholder outcomes. For
            example, when your investors see that your human capability efforts deliver results, they gain confidence in the
            future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Support your Human Capability roadmap with a measurement system. It is insufficient to use only outcome-based
            measures
            to effectively deploy your roadmap. Use the metrics in the Actionable Insights section to create a scorecard for
            each
            prioritized initiative and for the entire roadmap with a combination of lead and lag measures, and a balanced mix of
            activity, process, behavioral and outcome measures. Many measures can be monitored on quarterly, monthly or even
            shorter
            cycle times. Establishing a measurement system to monitor and communicate metrics are a component of the most
            effective
            Human Capability building plans.

            6: Share and Reinforce - Intentionally disclose Human Capability efforts
        </h3>
        <p>
            There is an old adage that if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it make a sound? This adage applies to Human Capability communications. You should make intentional choices about what Human Capability work you choose to disclose to have effective conversations with specific stakeholder groups. High impact SEC disclosures require a cross functional team to integrate the right content and message reflecting investor, board, legal, financial and employee perspectives. On the one hand, transparent disclosure increases stakeholder confidence; on the other hand, your Human Capability work may be your “secret sauce”, so it’s important to create an intentional disclosure posture.

            A critical step in engaging stakeholders to understand and support your plan is to decide how and what to communicate about your Human Capability roadmap and investments. First select what information to share. Consider how to build stakeholder understanding of what Human Capability is, why it matters, where you score, what are the desired future targets based on strategy and your competitive peers, and what actions comprise your plan. Second, engage key stakeholders and show the value of your plan. Figure 7 shows some of the key messages and settings to consider when engaging each stakeholder group.

        <h3>Milestones of this step include:</h3>
        <ul class="stand-alone-ul">
            <li>Establish a cross functional team to create your disclosure</li>
            <li>Define an intentional disclosure posture</li>
            <li>Create a robust and high leverage disclosure</li>
            <li>Create a communication plan for your disclosure – what, how and to whom</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion and action</strong></p>
        <p>
            Human Capability should be a critical part of presentations to investors, boards, executive teams, leaders at all
            levels, and HR. Following the six steps outlined above will make these often abstract ideas more impactful with
            specific frameworks, actions, and metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you take targeted action, improve your disclosures, and track your progress, you will see increased employee,
            financial, and community results. By using the Human Capability framework, you have a standardized and rigorous
            roadmap
            that will shape your Human Capability agenda in a manner that allows you to benchmark others in your industry - as
            well
            as the top companies reporting - on the same indicators.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope our work will help move this agenda forward. See: <a href="www.g3humancapability.com">www.g3humancapability.com</a> for more information to support your

            Appendix 1: SEC Human Capital Requirement
        </h2>
        <p>
            The SEC Rule on Human Capital comes via the Federal Register - Final Rule: Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105; Release Nos. 33-10825; 34-89670; File No. S7-11-19 on November 9, 2020. These rules modernize the requirements of Regulation S-K applicable to disclosure of the description of the business (Item 101), legal proceedings (Item 103) and risk factors (Item 105). This greatly expands Human Capability management disclosures. Today, reporting structure is not detailed, so companies are free to report Human Capital items in any way they choose. The wording of the rule is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            Item 101(c)(2)(ii): Provide “A description of the registrant’s Human Capital resources, including the number of persons employed by the registrant, and any Human Capital measures or objectives that the registrant focuses on in managing
            the business (such as, depending on the nature of the registrant’s business and workforce, measures or objectives that address the development, attraction and retention of personnel).”

                Talent (also called Human Capital) deals with initiatives to ensure the right individual competence, workforce, or people: Improving how employees work through hiring based on cultural fit, orienting new employees to their job, hybrid work that determines where and how employees work, focusing on worktasks and skills more than roles, creating total reward systems to motivate employees, attending to employee physical health and psychological well-being, reskilling the workforce, managing employee careers, using digital communications, creating a DEI agenda, managing employee mobility through retention and removal efforts, building a better employee experience, and so forth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leadership emphasizes initiatives improving the quality of both individual leaders and collective leadership by: Building a business case for leadership, defining what makes an effective leader, assessing quality of leaders and
                leadership, investing in leadership development training and coaching, measuring leadership results, and ensuring leadership reputation.

            <li>
                Organization (structure, governance, or culture) focuses on initiatives that define and ensure the right organization capabilities such as: Agility (moving quickly to adapt to change), strategic clarity (having a compelling purpose or mission), technology adoption (accessing digital information to reinvent work), culture (having alignment of the employee experience, firm brand, and customer experience), social responsibility (being a good social citizen), customer focus (increasing customer intimacy), innovation (discovering and delivering new ways to work), collaboration (working in networks or ecosystems), and so forth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Human Resources refers to the HR function or department and how to accomplish HR work by: Upgrading the HR department by ensuring the right reputation, serving customers, having a clear purpose, governing and organizing to deliver HR work, doing HR analytics, improving HR professionals, building positive work relationships, and so forth.
            </li>

            This Human Capability framework in Figure 2 and 37 initiatives in Figure 5 helps @Model.CompanyName business and HR leaders define, invest in, prioritize, measure, and improve Human Capability much like the SEC required financial disclosures (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) to guide financial decisions.

            These research studies help identify the extent to which specific initiatives in each pathway are deployed. Further, this research links the Human Capability initiatives in each pathway to stakeholder outcomes by asking “so that” or
            “because of” to ensure the linkages. Figure 10 shows the logic of creating value through Human Capability investments. This research confirms that Human Capability initiatives impact firm performance across industries and geographies.
        </p>

            Appendix 4: Innovative Human Capability research using machine learning
        </h2>
        <p>
            To overcome survey limitations, this report uses information reported in the mandated 10-K SEC disclosures. Results in this report come from extracting all sentences related to Human Capability for each of the SEC filing companies who reported to the SEC in @Model.YearString by using the Human Capability definitions for the four pathways in Figure 2.
        </p>
        <p>Then, using proprietary machine learning technology, seed words for each of the four pathways were identified and word lists for each of the four pathways were created. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Talent = talent + employee + competence</li>
            <li>Leadership = leadership + management + develop</li>
            <li>Organization = organization + culture + agility + mission + vision + capability</li>
            <li>HR = Human Capital + human resources</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Using these word lists, the fraction of the Human Capability text that contains the words in a given list were used to create @Model.CompanyName’s score on each of the four pathways with a normalized range from 1 to 10. This scoring enables
            an analysis of how @Model.CompanyName stands in relation to others based on their Human Capability reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The benefit of applying this Human Capability framework to SEC reports is that these reports are for regulatory compliance where firms are accountable for integrity. This is not the case for media reports, ratings, or earnings calls,
            which may be more promotional. Further, manual processing and interpretation of surveys does not scale, whereas machine learning processing of SEC filings enables scaling to all companies disclosing public data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Human Capability framework and machine learning analytics has limitations. The Human Capability framework is based on extensive research but could miss some elements of how your organization attends to talent, leadership, organization,
            and HR. The information analyzed came from company reports to the SEC and companies had few requirements on what to report.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, new SEC disclosure rules are likely to emerge that will increase the value and importance of the Human Capability framework as a means to look back at what has been done and look forward to potential improvement opportunities that lie ahead.  The ability to track progress over time will allow organizations to benchmark their progress against enhanced reporting and investments of all companies filing 10-K disclosures and compare themselves to industry peers and those with world class Human Capability results. AI-driven analysis will also evolve in ways that will allow the inclusion of multiple data sources (such as proxy statements, ESG reports, or other specific Human Capability reports) and allow more granular data analysis into each of the four Human Capability pathways defined in this framework.
